# SNOMED-CT Language Metadata
Useful metadata for using SNOMED CT editions from around the world.

Most national editions include country specific language reference sets. Some of these contain descriptions from just one language and some do not. Some include every SNOMED CT cocnept and some do not. Some language reference sets are designed to be used in conjunction with other national or international language reference sets.

Implementors need to understand what language reference sets are available and which conbination of language refsets and languages should be used for specific audiences. This repository aims to provide that information.

Having this information online in a machine readable format enables terminology servers and their client applications to be metadata driven therefore reducing the need for hardcoding.
